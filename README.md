# Random-Password-Generator
This webpage takes user input and generates a random password based on what the user selects, with a minimum of 8 and maximum of 128 characters.
Users can go through 4 different options of uppercase, lowercase, special, and numeric characters to choose their password outcome.
After completing all the prompts, the users new randomly generated password will be displayed in the text area.

Application works upon loading page. However, if the user wishes to generate more than one password with different criteria than the first, the originally selected criteria does not clear, and the resulting password will still contain all previously selected inputs. There was an attempt to fix this with no avail.
